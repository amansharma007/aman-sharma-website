        <h2><strong>Who Is Aman Sharma?</strong></h2>
        <p>I am an enginnering student who is pursuing B.Tech from <strong>BK Birla Institute of Engineering and Technology</strong> <em>(not BITS!)</em>. I have been studying Computer Science as my major subject here <em>(And yeah, I am not a geek!)</em>.<br>
        I have always been fond of things that are in someways realted to technology but what actually really draws me towards itself is not even technology. It's <strong>Creativity</strong> that truely attracts me. That feeling to something out of something very insufficient for creating that thing.<br><br>
        But what I truely aspire to become in the world of <em>technology</em> is either one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
        
            <li>Full Stack Developer</li>
            <li>Software Engineer</li>
            
        </ul>
